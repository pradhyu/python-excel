# Stress Test Queries for Massive Datasets

## Basic Queries (Should be fast with SQLite cache)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM massive_employees.data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM massive_transactions.data

## Filtering Queries
SELECT * FROM massive_employees.data WHERE salary > 150000 LIMIT 1000
SELECT * FROM massive_transactions.data WHERE total_amount > 5000 LIMIT 1000

## Aggregation Queries (Test GROUP BY performance)
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(salary) as avg_salary 
FROM massive_employees.data 
GROUP BY department

SELECT region, SUM(total_amount) as revenue, COUNT(*) as transactions
FROM massive_transactions.data 
GROUP BY region

## Complex Queries
SELECT department, location, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(annual_compensation) as avg_comp
FROM massive_employees.data 
WHERE performance_rating >= 4 
GROUP BY department, location 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100
ORDER BY avg_comp DESC
LIMIT 50

SELECT product, region, SUM(total_amount) as revenue, SUM(profit) as profit
FROM massive_transactions.data 
WHERE transaction_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY product, region 
ORDER BY revenue DESC 
LIMIT 100

## Window Functions (Test advanced features)
SELECT employee_id, full_name, salary, department,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
FROM massive_employees.data 
WHERE department IN ('Engineering', 'Sales', 'Marketing')
LIMIT 1000
